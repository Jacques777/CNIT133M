                I grew up in Texas but finished my BS in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis in Physics, a minor in Astronomy and a specialization in Data Science/AI/Data Mining in R degree at San Francisco State University (SFSU). I have lived in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1993. I took a leave from work to have my one and only offspring and further my career in the web development/cybersecurity and data science industries as well as to start Datum Victual.
                My long term academic goal is to study Quantum Physics in application to Quantum Computing.
                I know 18 languages (human and computer combined).

            I am currently working for myself as a Fullstack Web Developer/Data Scientist/Database Engineer.
            I received funding to create Datum Victual.

            <hr>
            I have participated teams of four to five developers in web development projects utilizing many skills from the Front End Web Development classes that I have taken in this school. in
            (see or other
            libraries and computer languages in practice).<br> Currently, I am working with MySQL/PHP, Linux/Python, HTML/CSS/VANILLA JS/Bootstrap to get my organization Datum Victual off the ground. I have obtained a Cloud Practitioner Graduate Badge from the AWS Academy.
            I am also preparing for my CompTIA+, CompTIA Network+, and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification exams. I qualify to take the CISSP as having been a Custodian of HIPPA and PHI information for 11 years as a Human Language Medical Interpreter/Translator. <br>As my post baccalaureate education I have finished up (and finishing up) four certificates from City College of San Francisco's (CCSF) Computer Networking and Information Technology (CNIT) Department certificates, adding four plus years to my education/experience for a total of 10 years of education/experience combined in tech. See link for Software Engineering Certificate: <a target="_blank" href="https://ccsf.curricunet.com/Report/Program/GetReport/995?reportId=29" rel="noopener">Advanced Front End Web Development. </a>  I have also finished (and finishing up) three other cybersecurity certificates.
